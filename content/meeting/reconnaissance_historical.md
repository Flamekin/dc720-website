## Recap

We had a good turn out tonight to talk about recon, and how to collect as much
infromation as you can about a person, place, or thing. Whether your using
shodan to gather infromation or talking about using custom google searches as a
method for cataloging your recon data.

With eight in attendence for the evening, we talked through some of the great
tools that are out there.

For our next meeting we will go through and talk through CTF's and it looks like
we will have a good group to talk through.
