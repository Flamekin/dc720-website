Hot on the heels of DEFCON 26, I am looking to meet with other like minded
hackers in Boulder and the surrounding area.  So, if you didn't make it to Hacker Summer Camp this year, or you are looking to make it last all year long, please join us.

## Recap

Wow... There is no way that I could have expected this level of turn out for the
meeting (13 people), so we have started DC720. Thanks to everyone who joined us
and all of the members showing interest in absentia.  We had a good time talking
through some interesting topics as well as some good outreach projects.

For those interested in the community but were unable to make it, feel free to
join our Slack channel:
